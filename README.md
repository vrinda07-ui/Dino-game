# Dino-game
This project is a heartfelt tribute to the Chrome Dino game that defined countless childhood moments during internet outages.
Dino Game – A Gesture of Childhood
This project is more than just a game it’s a heartfelt tribute to the timeless Dino runner we all played when the internet went out. But instead of tapping a keyboard, I brought my Dino to life using my hands literally.

Using OpenCV and MediaPipe, I created a hand-tracking Dino game where the dinosaur jumps every time I raise my hand. It brought back memories of simpler times, now rebuilt with the skills I’ve grown to love. Every jump, every cactus dodged, feels like a tiny high-five to my childhood self.

What started as a nostalgic idea turned into a deeply rewarding learning experience in computer vision, gesture control, and game logic—all packed into one interactive OpenCV window.
